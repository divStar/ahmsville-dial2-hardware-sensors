# AhmsVille Dial 2 hardware sensor adapters
This package contains the hardware sensor adapter for the AhmsVille Dial 2.

It depends on the AhmsVille Dial2 sensor adapter interfaces, but contains the implementations of the interfaces
for the real device.

In contrast to the AhmsVille Dial 2 sensor adapter interfaces, this package is expected to contain `Arduino` dependencies.

These adapters are only supposed to ever be used in the actual firmware of the device.
